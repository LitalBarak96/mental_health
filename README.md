# 🧠 Mental Health Analysis & Prediction

This project explores and analyzes mental health data with the goal of uncovering patterns and predicting mental illness prevalence. It includes:

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🤖 Machine Learning models for prediction
- 📈 Interactive Dashboard with Streamlit

---

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/imtkaggleteam/mental-health-eda-prediction/input), and includes multiple CSVs covering:
- Prevalence of various mental health disorders by country and year
- Suicide rates
- Risk factors (e.g., substance use, poverty)

---

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Understand mental health trends across time and geography
- Visualize key insights in a user-friendly dashboard
- Build a machine learning model to predict the prevalence of disorders based on risk factors

---

## 📊 EDA Highlights
- Trends in depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia
- Correlation between mental illness and external factors
- Country-level comparisons and outliers

---

## 🧠 ML Models
Planned models:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost

Target: predict prevalence rate of selected mental disorders

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard
Streamlit dashboard to:
- Filter by country/year/disorder
- Visualize trends and distributions
- Explore model predictions

### Run it locally:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Streamlit

---

## 📌 To Do
- [x] Basic EDA
- [ ] Clean and merge all datasets
- [ ] Build initial ML model
- [ ] Build Streamlit dashboard
- [ ] Add prediction section to dashboard
